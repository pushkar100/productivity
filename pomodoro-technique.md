# Pomodoro 

## Theory

- Any long task can be broken down into ***short, timed intervals***
- Each is separated by a small break, taking advantage of the fact that our brains have limited attention spans
- Every interval plus the break is ***one pomodoro cycle***

## The Technique

1. **Choose a task to be accomplished**
	- Keep only 1 task, preferrably a long one. No multitasking
	- Do not check your phone or social media when doing that task
	- Keep all the things you need to complete the task with you already! 
		- It includes pen, paper, highlighters, sticky notes, etc (any stationery you need)
		- Don't search for them within those 25 study minutes
	- Keep a ***NOTEPAD*** and a ***pen***:
		- So that you can write down the thoughts that come into your head which you can act upon later
		- Example: Write down things like 'taking out trash', 'call a friend', etc
		- Writing them down and keeping the book aside helps your remember to do them later
		- This allows you to focus back on the task!
2. **Set the timer to 25 minutes and work until the timer rings**
	- The exact time interval can vary from person to person (Roughly, anywhere between 20-40 minutes)
	- Do *not* keep checking the timer constantly during this time
	- Keep away from distractions (No phone/social media). ***Intense focus*** is needed
3. **Take a 5 minute break and restart the task**
	- Take it away from your study area
	- Can be too distracting if you are still focused - You may continue to stall the break time until your focus starts to wane!
		- It is okay to stretch the interval of study when you are in the zone i.e focused on some task
		- Do not stretch it for too long however. This prevents burnout
	- What you do during this break is totally up to you:
		- You can stretch (physical activity)
		- Check your phone, take out trash, perform something from a TODO list, etc
	- When the break is over, reset the timer and restart your work
4. **Take a longer (20-30 minute) break every 4 Pomodoro cycles**
	- Have lunch or any meal
	- Go for a walk
	- This break must take you away from your desk for a while and clears your mind.

After 4 pomodoros, *call it a day* if you can!

## Goal

- To help you to get into the zone and focus
- To also remind you to come up for air i.e needed breaks
- Tracking your completed pomodoros helps you track your sweet spot i.e how you spend your time on a task (How productive you are and at what time)

## Overcoming external distractions

If someone distracts you in the middle of it, try the ***Inform***, ***Negotiate***, ***Callback*** strategy:
- Inform them that you are in the middle of something
- Negotiate a time at which you can get back to them
- Callback when you are finished

## When to use it?

- Start small. For example, keep the commitment to just one pomodoro cycle
- It gets easier to keep moving when you have built momentum
- Usually a good technique while ***studying from textbooks***, ***doing background reading*** for research project, ***reading technical articles***, etc


## Conclusion

- Consistency is important
- You may complete all 4 pomodoros or not - but keep doing as much as you can, regularly
- Pomodoro is a ***template***. Do not follow it blindly. You can change it from 25+5 to even 40+5 if you feel that helps you more. But, don't push it
